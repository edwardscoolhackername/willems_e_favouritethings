## Battle Plan:
 - Favourite Songs of 2021. Narrow it down to 5.
 - Album art links.
 - Fetch Title, Artist, Genre, Audio, Album Art, and Description from data.json file to populate lightbox. 
 - Use Game of Thrones project as a base for Lightbox script, especially changing information/pictures on a link click.
 - Audio links. Copy GoT function of restarting songs on Close.
